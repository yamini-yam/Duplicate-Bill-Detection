🧾 Intelligent Expense Receipt Processor (TinyBERT + EasyOCR)

This project automates expense extraction and duplicate detection from receipts using OCR and a fine-tuned TinyBERT model.

🚀 Overview

This system extracts key details such as Description, Amount, Date, and Bill Number from scanned or generated bills, then uses a fine-tuned TinyBERT model to detect duplicate entries in an expense dataset.

⚙️ Features

🧠 Text Extraction: Extracts text from bills using EasyOCR.
🔍 Field Extraction: Automatically identifies key fields with regex.
🤖 Duplicate Detection: Fine-tuned TinyBERT identifies duplicates accurately.
📊 Dataset Update: Appends new, unique records to the CSV file.
🏋️ Model Training: Fine-tunes TinyBERT on generated pairwise data for duplicate classification.

🧩 Tech Stack

Python 3.10+
Libraries: easyocr, transformers, pandas, datasets, scikit-learn, torch
Model: huawei-noah/TinyBERT_General_4L_312D
Framework: Hugging Face Transformers

🧾 Workflow

Extract text from the bill using EasyOCR.
Parse and normalize extracted fields.
Check for duplicates using the TinyBERT model.
Update dataset automatically if unique.

🧠 Model Training

Generate text pairs using expense data.
Label pairs (1 = duplicate, 0 = non-duplicate).
Train TinyBERT using:
Learning rate: 2e-5
Batch size: 16
Epochs: 5
Early stopping enabled

📊 Results

OCR Accuracy: High accuracy on printed receipts.
Duplicate Detection: Reliable classification with balanced training data.
Automation: Prevents duplicate expense entries and ensures data integrity.
